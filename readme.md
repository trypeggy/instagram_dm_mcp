This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for sending instagram Direct Messages.

With this you can send Instagram Direct Messages from your account (more capabilities coming soon).

Here's an example of what you can do when it's connected to Claude.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Anthropic Claude Desktop app (or Cursor)
- Pip (Python package manager), install with `python -m pip install`
- An instagram account

### Steps

1. **Clone this repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/trypeggy/instagram_dm_mcp.git
   cd instagram_dm_mcp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

  - Using uv (recommended):
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```
  - Using Pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Configure Instagram credentials**

   You have two options for providing your Instagram credentials:

   **Option A: Environment Variables (Recommended)**
   
   **Quick Setup (Recommended):**
   
   Run the helper script:
   
   ```bash
   python setup_env.py
   ```
   
   This will interactively prompt you for your credentials and create the `.env` file securely.
   
   **Manual Setup:**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```
   
   Then edit `.env` with your actual credentials:
   
   ```
   INSTAGRAM_USERNAME=your_instagram_username
   INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD=your_instagram_password
   ```
   
   **Option B: Command Line Arguments**
   
   You can still pass credentials as command line arguments (less secure).

4. **Connect to the MCP server**

   **For Claude Desktop:**
   
   Save this as `claude_desktop_config.json` in your Claude Desktop configuration directory at:

   ```
   ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

   **For Cursor:**
   
   Save this as `mcp.json` in your Cursor configuration directory at:

   ```
   ~/.cursor/mcp.json
   ```

   **Configuration with Environment Variables (Recommended):**
   - Using uv
   
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "instagram_dms": {
           "command": "uv",
           "args": [
             "run",
             "--directory",
             "PATH/TO/instagram_dm_mcp",
             "python",
             "src/mcp_server.py"
           ]
        }
      }
    }
   ```

   - Using Python
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "instagram_dms": {
          "command": "python",
          "args": [
            "{{PATH_TO_SRC}}/instagram_dm_mcp/src/ mcp_server.py"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

   **Configuration with Command Line Arguments:**
   
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "instagram_dms": {
         "command": "python",
         "args": [
           "{{PATH_TO_SRC}}/instagram_dm_mcp/src/mcp_server.py",
           "--username",
           "{{YOUR_INSTAGRAM_USERNAME}}",
          "--password",
          "{{YOUR_INSTAGRAM_PASSWORD}}"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Restart Claude Desktop / Cursor**
   
   Open Claude Desktop and you should now see the Instagram DM MCP as an available integration.

   Or restart Cursor.

## Troubleshooting

**Instagram Login Hanging:** The server now includes automatic session management to prevent login hangs. Session files (e.g., `username_session.json`) are automatically created and reused to maintain authentication state between runs.

For additional Claude Desktop integration troubleshooting, see the [MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server#claude-for-desktop-integration-issues). The documentation includes helpful tips for checking logs and resolving common issues.
